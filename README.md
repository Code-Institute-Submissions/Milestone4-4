## What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?
This Milestone project creation is the culmination of learning and study from all modules of the Full Stack Developer Course, culminating in the creation of this Full Stack Framework Django project. This Application will allow an admin to store and manipulate data records and also allow users to create, read, update, delete & purchase memberships for this newly create local barbell club called, <a href="https://php-barbell.herokuapp.com/">PHP Barbell</a>.

### Functionality of Project
The application uses Django 3 to encourage rapid development, by following a model-template-view architecture pattern. The project uses Separation of Concern amongst the applications to utilise the Django Framework effectively.

Alongside using Django, sqlite was used in the Project's inception phase as a test database for local testing. Sqlite is self-contained highly reliable, SQL database engine that features all the normal relational database management. Once I was ready I switch to using PostGreSQL (aka Postgres), for my Development Database to ensure that any data entered was visible in my deployed application. Postgres is open source and boosts a fully technical and easy to use Object relational database management system.

Using Django and the above Database methods an administrator for the application (in this case the owner of PHP Barbell), has complete access to a completely custom styled Admin dashboard where they can Create, Read, Update and Delete records in the each proposing application model if appropriate. For example: The owner access the admin dashboard to update staff records, which is a totally separate and completely custom Django application made specifically for this purpose.

The project is version controlled via Git & Github and is deployed via Heroku. All environment variables & secret variables are stored in an env.py file which is then held in a git ignored file to ensure project integrity is held to a high secure present day and project requirements standard.

#### Design
I rather enjoy learning new ways to style my projects and I feel more and more that Front End Development and Design is my calling in this profession. Earlier this year I saw an article on the rising trend of Neumorphism in the industry and I was hooked. I knew from then that I was going to try and utilise this methodology in my final project as it really brings an application to life.

It is a by-product of recent trendsetting Skeumorphism which takes a material polish approach to creating good user experience. For example, using symbolism to portray an act or action, eg: the recycle bin icon or making a particular element's background have a textile styling that would be familiar to a User. But Neumorphism uses imaginary light sources and their respective highlights & shadowing from same to make the elements on show look as if they are still part of the background from which they are almost protruding or sinking into. It's nickname in the industry today is _**Soft UI**_. 

For this project, I imagined a light source installed in the top left corner of the webpage. This allowed me to visualise where the light would hit on these elements causing highlights and shadows. Then using the css property of `box-shadow` to impact the element based on the above to create the shadows & highlights necessary. This css property uses horizontal & vertical offsetting along with blur and spread and finally the color of the shadow itself to produce the desired effect.  

By using rounded edges on the components, eg: cards, and removing conventional borders entirely it allowed for some very creative visuals, almost as if it were one seamless plastic moulding being rendered for the user.

As an example of putting all of the above to use the following is the Login Form card with Neumorphism styles in place:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/auxfuse/Milestone4/blob/master/Milestone4/static/wireframes/neumorphismExample.PNG" alt="Neumorphism Styled Form">
</p>

##### 1. Font
The project has a main font of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed">Roboto Condensed</a> which is used for primary texts and headers, and a secondary font of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato">Lato</a>, both of which greatly complement each other throughout the site.
  
“Sans-Serif” is used as the default backup font in cases where these fonts have difficulty loading. "Roboto Condensed" consists of a dual nature, sporting a mechanical skeleton and character form is largely geometric, and at the same time featuring friendly and open curves. This allows for a more natural reading Rhythm more commonly found with humanist and serif fonts. This made it a clear choice in terms of primary font as the website ideology is that of natural form and geometric positioning.

 "Lato" is the secondary font used to compliment the primary font. Again, this typeface is of the serif family, contains classical proportions (particularly in upper case), but holds a strong structure providing stability and seriousness. It reads well alongside "Roboto Condensed" and ultimately was a great fit with the overall theme of the application.

##### 2. Color Scheme
This project was actually inspired by a friend of mine and his new venture as a local gym, that gym is called <a href="https://precisionhealthperformance.com/">Precision, Health & Performance</a> and they specialise in doing exactly what the name says. Their is already a commercial website in place and the color scheme for it is monotone in nature with color only added via images noted throughout the site. The guys at PHP were kind enough and offered me their commercially built website as my project medium. I noticed that although it was incredibly intricate and quite simple and pleasing on the eye it needed something to just separate the monotone coloring.

* ![#323232](https://placehold.it/15/323232/000000?text=+) `#323232` - Primary color
* ![#432344](https://placehold.it/15/432344/000000?text=+) `#432344` - Secondary color
* ![#ffc03d](https://placehold.it/15/ffc03d/000000?text=+) `#ffc03d` - Tertiary color
* ![#efeeee](https://placehold.it/15/efeeee/000000?text=+) `#efeeee` - Supplementary color

The primary color of ![#323232](https://placehold.it/15/323232/000000?text=+) `#323232` was used to denote key componentry used in the application such as the Navbar & Footer. It's almost charcoal grey color emulates the color of the knurling found in many modern barbells and it ultimately was only a hue percentage off the logo dominate color that it became the obvious choice.

The secondary color of ![#432344](https://placehold.it/15/432344/000000?text=+) `#432344` is used throughout the site as Primary call to actions, Login/Register buttons, Create Posts/Comment buttons etc and change hue and directional gradient when hovered & pressed. It is the introduction of monochromatic coloring in the website as multiple hues of lightening or darkening tints are used to create the animations and the gradients. It is also used in creating a very light hued version for the shadows on the neumorphic elements.

The Tertiary color of ![#ffc03d](https://placehold.it/15/ffc03d/000000?text=+) `#ffc03d` and again using monochromatic techniques are used for animating the navigational elements in the navbar & footer partial components, and also providing a bright contrast on some of the custom horizontal block dividers. They are also used to show the user via highlight the current page being viewed in the navbar.

Finally the Supplementary color of ![#efeeee](https://placehold.it/15/efeeee/000000?text=+) `#efeeee` is used as the default page body background and also as the font color used when contrast of black text is poor against the monochrome theme of the website, for example: the navigation list items in the navbar and footer.

##### 3. Logo
The logo was provided by Dean Roche, the owner of PHP as a complimentary gesture to help and aid me in the development of this site and the content within. Without this asset, I would of spent a lengthy period of time creating a logo to my liking.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/auxfuse/Milestone4/blob/master/Milestone4/static/img/logo.png" alt="PHP Logo">
</p>

##### 4. Geometry

The applications geometrical aspects feature aesthetically modern components such as rounded edges and Neumorphism styling. Plenty of whitespace was used to allow the user to flick to important context and features much easier with little strain provoked in their eyes.

A rule of symmetrical grouping was used horizontally and the rule of thirds was implemented vertically on most pages where content would allow. For example, most pages feature a descriptive context for the user, a branding logo as separation but also to invoke that brand in the user's mind-eye when remembering from reference and the actual content necessary for that page.

Form inputs were kept label-less to keep with the Neumorphism trend and all form inputs use a placeholder as form label to still direct the user as to the information that the field requires. 

##### 5. Wireframing

Wireframing for this project began with Pen and paper as all my projects tend to start, but ultimately Wireframes were created using Balsamiq. Each page or view of the application was rendered as a wireframe in both Small and Medium-Large viewports to show the difference between the aesthetics and showing how the elements per page would react to differing viewport sizes. Each element planned out in this stage has made it into the physical build of the application with not much deviation occurring from the original wireframe plans.

* Base Template:
The base.html parent template contained all the default components for each child template to inherit from. All links were provided to third party icon providers, frameworks, stylesheets and script links. The navbar & footer partial components were created in their own html files and inserted into the base.html via the Jinja `include` statement to ensure separation of concern could occur for ease of scalability of the application elements. 

  Where appropriate, `block` statements were used for the Page titles, the main inheritance portion in the body and finally for any bespoke scripts that needed to be loaded on specific pages.
  ```html
  {% block content %}
  {& endblock %}
  ```

#### Found Bugs & Fixes:

During manual testing...

1. When implementing Travis (at the inception of my project), I ran into a rather bespoke bug whereas the build would not pass even though I had what seemed to be the correct code (see below):
    ```yaml
    language: python
    python:
      - "3.8"
    # command to install dependencies
    install:
      - "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
    # command to run tests
    script:
      - SECRET_KEY="whatever" ./manage.py test
    ```
   The error appeared in the logs whenever the script would attempt to run and pass the secret_key. With help from <a href="https://github.com/10xOXR">Chris Quinn</a> in the <a href="https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C7HS3U3AP/p1583432481074600">Slack Full Stack Frameworks</a> channel, I was able to rectify this issue thanks to his guidance. Chris also explained to me the reason why this was happening. It is down to a default linux permission of 644 being set on my basic `./manage.py` meaning it is not executable via the script. Changing this to `python manage.py test` allowed Python to call and run the file circumventing Travis now potentially enforcing file permissions when testing builds. 

2. When developing the Privacy Policy & Accessibility Statement templates, I encountered a strange visual bug where overflow-x was persistent even though the flow of the code followed the Bootstrap structure to the letter, `container > row > col`. This was caused by my use of auto margin on the `.content` section element. I was using margin to push the content down away from the navbar as this project uses a sticky property to fix the navbar to the top of the viewport at all times, regardless of scroll position. After a lengthy period of time debugging and turning to Slack for help, <a href="https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C7HS3U3AP/p1583710151076600">Simen Daehlin</a> pointed out the issue could be potentially coming from my `.content` css code block of:
    ```css
    .content {
        margin: 77px auto 0;
        -webkit-box-flex: 1;
                -ms-flex: 1;
                    flex: 1;
    }
    ```
   After which I turned my attention to the code block in question and using devtools was able to narrow down my search to the left and right auto margin property being the culprit. For some reason it was causing the site and the actual components injected inside the block content to no longer be responsive. Removing the `auto` value rectified this visual bug.
