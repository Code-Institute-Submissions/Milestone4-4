## What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?
This Milestone project creation is the culmination of learning and study from all modules of the Full Stack Developer Course, culminating in the creation of this Full Stack Framework Django project. This Application will allow an admin to store and manipulate data records and also allow users to create, read, update, delete & purchase memberships for this newly create local barbell club called, <a href="">PHP Barbell</a>.

### Functionality of Project
This application contains ....

## User Experience:

#### Design

##### 1. Font
The project has a main font of <a href="">Roboto Condensed</a> which is used for primary texts and headers, and a secondary font of <a href="">Lato</a>, both of which greatly complement each other throughout the site.
  
“Sans-Serif” is used as the default backup font in cases where these fonts have difficulty loading.
Roboto Condensed sports a unique ...

The secondary font of Lato has a natural flow...

##### 2. Color Scheme
This project went through multiple theme iterations whilst in Wireframe stage. Ultimately, I was always lead back to professional high contrast finish that would normally be seen in most day-to-day apps with a touch of pastel color to highlight to the user the breakaway elements.

* ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000` - Primary color
* ![#432344](https://placehold.it/15/432344/000000?text=+) `#432344` - Secondary color
* ![#ffc03d](https://placehold.it/15/ffc03d/000000?text=+) `#ffc03d` - Tertiary color
* ![#ff2525](https://placehold.it/15/ff2525/000000?text=+) `#ff2525` - Supplementary color #1
* ![#e7eefb](https://placehold.it/15/e7eefb/000000?text=+) `#e7eefb` - Supplementary color #2

##### 5. Wireframing

Wireframing for this project began with Pen and paper as all my projects tend to start, but ultimately Wireframes were created using Balsamiq. Each page or view of the application was rendered as a wireframe in both Small and Medium-Large viewports to show the difference between the aesthetics and showing how the elements per page would react to differing viewport sizes. Each element planned out in this stage has made it into the physical build of the application with not much deviation occurring from the original wireframe plans.

#### Found Bugs & Fixes:

During manual testing...

1. When implementing Travis (at the inception of my project), I ran into a rather bespoke bug whereas the build would not pass even though I had what seemed to be the correct code (see below):
    ```yaml
    language: python
    python:
      - "3.8"
    # command to install dependencies
    install:
      - "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
    # command to run tests
    script:
      - SECRET_KEY="whatever" ./manage.py test
    ```
   The error appeared in the logs whenever the script would attempt to run and pass the secret_key. With help from <a href="https://github.com/10xOXR">Chris Quinn</a> in the <a href="https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C7HS3U3AP/p1583432481074600">Slack Full Stack Frameworks</a> channel, I was able to rectify this issue thanks to his guidance. Chris also explained to me the reason why this was happening. It is down to a default linux permission of 644 being set on my basic `./manage.py` meaning it is not executable via the script. Changing this to `python manage.py test` allowed Python to call and run the file circumventing Travis now potentially enforcing file permissions when testing builds. 

2. When developing the Privacy Policy & Accessibility Statement templates, I encountered a strange visual bug where overflow-x was persistent even though the flow of the code followed the Bootstrap structure to the letter, `container > row > col`. This was caused by my use of auto margin on the `.content` section element. I was using margin to push the content down away from the navbar as this project uses a sticky property to fix the navbar to the top of the viewport at all times, regardless of scroll position. After a lengthy period of time debugging and turning to Slack for help, <a href="https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C7HS3U3AP/p1583710151076600">Simen Daehlin</a> pointed out the issue could be potentially coming from my `.content` css code block of:
    ```css
    .content {
        margin: 77px auto 0;
        -webkit-box-flex: 1;
                -ms-flex: 1;
                    flex: 1;
    }
    ```
   After which I turned my attention to the code block in question and using devtools was able to narrow down my search to the left and right auto margin property being the culprit. For some reason it was causing the site and the actual components injected inside the block content to no longer be responsive. Removing the `auto` value rectified this visual bug.
